________________
Project Summary (1 page):


The project is a social-media application, primarily to be configured for mobile devices, that is focused around a central map. Users can “pin” a location on this map and then invite other users to hang out. 


They can set up a proposed time and description or links of what will be happening in the area, temporary group chats for these events can be created which will be deleted after the pin is removed. You can set public events that can be seen by mutual friends or keep everything private. You can “favourite” locations that you frequently visit as well as groups of friends you normally hang out with.


At these events with your friends, you can upload photos to the pin that can be shared publicly or kept private afterwards. Users who were at the event will receive these photos, which can be posted on a timeline. This timeline could also include advertisements and events listed by bars, clubs or societies to let people know about future events.


We decided to go for a project like this because there were always discrepancies when we were organising events with our friends. Whether it was people talking on different platforms or they were unsure of location or time, it can cause a bit of a headache. We are making the app we would have found useful throughout (and after) our college tenure.

Expected Technical Delivery (1 page):




Early in the development process, we would like to complete a pen-pot model of what the final app should look like. This would give us an idea of how we would like to progress with our UI / UX.


In our final project delivery, we plan to deliver a fully functional application using either Flutter along a Python Django backend as well as Firebase. The main aspect of the application is the central map used to pin locations. We would be hoping to use a Google Maps or OpenStreetMaps Python API.


We would like to have a fully working build that could be tested in a real-life scenario.




________________


Market Rationale (1 page):


Our target market for this project is for adolescents. These could be those who are in college and want to socialise with their friends or those out of college looking to catch up with friends they haven't seen in a while. Students new to the school could use it too to meet new people and grow their social network for the rest of college and beyond.


We think we would do our market research with a constant flow of people. We are thinking of college campuses, parks and main streets. Gaining an idea of our age demographic will be important for how we continue. We plan to find folks travelling in groups and ask them some quick questions about how they planned to meet that day, and could that experience have been more streamlined, would they change anything?


We think a fruitful avenue to market the app could be to clubs and societies in Irish colleges. Hanging up a poster with a QR code or sending out an email with a link that can automatically add someone to a guestlist to a future event along with a pin of the exact building and room would simplify the process of inviting people to AGM, EGM or other events.
